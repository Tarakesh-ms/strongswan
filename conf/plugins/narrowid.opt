charon.plugins.narrowid.configs =
	Space separated list of CHILD_SA configurations to do narrowing for.

	For matching CHILD_SA configuration names, the plugin narrows the remote
	traffic selectors to any succesfully authenticated IPv4 or IPv6 IKE
	identity. Multiple configurations can be separated by spaces, no narrowing
	is done if the option is not set.
