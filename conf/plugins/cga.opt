charon.plugins.cga.trust = no
	Whether to trust CGA verified IPv6 identities.

	If set to yes, any CGA verified IPv6 identity is trusted and allows a
	peer to authenticate with that identity. As anybody can generate a CGA
	for a given public key, any peer can successfully authenticate with that
	CGA. To exclude CGA authenticated IDs from specific connection definitions,
	public key constraints may be used. Because of the security implications,
	CGA trust is disabled by default.
